# Hopper

## Getting Started

The development environment also runs on Windows (10 and 11) and Linux (x64 and ARM).

The Hopper Development environment can be rebuilt on Windows (10 and 11):
- clone the repo
- run the only .exe in the /Bin folder (HopperNET.exe)
- some documentation is included in the PDF under /Docs

And another quick hit on how the editor / IDE deals with "projects":

## Notes

Although Hopper programs run on desktop machines, like the entire development environment, the intended target for developers is applications for small devices.

From a security point of view, Hopper is:
- unable to escape from the root folder of the repo (Hopper thinks that subtree is your entire disc)
- aside from files in the repro tree, Hopper can only access the console, keyboard, mouse and serial port.

## Current State

The primary target for Hopper is small devices. This includes microcontrollers and 8 bit CPUs. In addition to running on the desktop (Windows, Linux..),
Hopper currently works on the 6502 and on RP2040/RP2350 microcontrollers.

Developing for the 6502 and MCUs is a first class IDE experience: source for both the editor (with syntax highlighting) and
the full symbolic source-level debugger are included (written in Hopper, of course). The debugger works live on the desktop accross the regular serial connection to your device.

## Toolset
All of these tools are written in Hopper and run and the Hopper Runtime on the desktop.

### Shell
The shell is the main windows when running under on the desktop. It is a command line interface written in Hopper that has also been ported to run on RP2040/RP2350 MCUs (via serial).
Type `help` or `man` for the list of available commands.

### Preprocess
First compilation phase which walks the entire project to collect definitions (the stuff outside the curly braces). `preprocess` outputs `<project.json>` which is consumed
by the Hopper compiler (`compile`) or the 6502 assembler (`assemble`).

### Compile
Second compilation phase for Hopper programs compiles the code within the methods (the stuff between the curly braces). `compile` generates `<project.code>` which is an intermediate format
of the Hopper VM instructions. It can be consumed by either the optimizer (`optimize`) or the code generator (`codegen`).

### Assemble
Second compilation phase for 6502 assembly programs assebles the code within the methods (the stuff between the curly braces). `assemble` generates `<project.code>` which
is an intermediate format of 6502 instructions. It can be consumed by either the 6502 optimizer (`optasm`) or the 6502 code generator (`asmgen`).

### Optimize
Optional phase that makes obvious optimizations to the intermediate output from the Hopper compiler. Consumes `<project.code>`, optimizes it and then outputs a new leaner and meaner `<project.code>`.

### OptAsm
Optional phase that makes obvious optimizations to the intermediate output from the 6502 assembler. Consumes `<project.code>`, optimizes it and then outputs a new leaner and meaner `<project.code>`.

### CodeGen
Transforms the Hopper intermediate format from `<project.code>` into Hopper VM byte code executable `<project.hexe>`. Also emits this same output as an Intel HEX file (`<project.ihexe>`) if the target
is an MCU or 6502. This Intel HEX is what is uploaded via the serial connection to your device.

### AsmGen
Transforms the 6502 intermediate format from `<project.code>` into 6502 executable machine code `<project.hex>`. This output is a Intel HEX file that can be burned to EEPROM or uploaded to the 6502 emulator (`e6502`).

### DASM
Disassembles Hopper binaries `<project.hexe>` into assembler listings `<project.hasm>`.

### 65DASM
Disassembles 6502 binaries `<project.hex>` into assembler listings `<project.lst>`.

### C Translator
`translate` is a tool that converts Hopper source into `C` code. This tool is currently used to migrate the Hopper Portable Runtime, via the Arduino IDE, to run as the Hopper Runtime on RP2040 MCUs.
Typically you'd build the Hopper project, `runtime` in this case, first. That way you know it is free of compilation errors before you try to translate it to `C`.
Since there is no Hopper memory management and garbage collection support in `C`, projects that can be translated will need to avoid using reference types and stick to value types.
The Hopper Portable runtime is such a project.

### Runtime
The portable runtime is written in Hopper and is used to generate the RP2040/RP2350 MCU runtime. It also runs under the Windows Runtime for emulation and testing.
It provides full support for Hopper `Debug` and `HopperMon` via synthesized `COM0` serial interface when running on Windows or via the actual serial interface when running on a MCU.

### MCU Runtime
Current state of Hopper on MCUs (via the Arduino IDE) is:
- tested on dozens of RP2040/RP2350 devices
- full support for the Hopper `Debug` and `HopperMon` via serial interface
- seperate configurable 64K code and 64K data segments (unlike 6502 which only has a monolithic 64K segment for code, data and stacks)
- GPIO API including digital, PWM, analog and pin interrupts
- LittleFS for Hopper file system (to store your current program too built-in FLASH)
- SD support via FAT file system mounted into the Hopper file system under `/SD/`
- I2C
- SPI
- Timer API including alarm events
- WiFi, web server and web client functionality
- numerous display drivers (written in Hopper) for OLED, TFT LCD and ePaper displays
  - text : scale, several fonts
  - simple graphics
- RTC drivers for 3 different chips (including alarm and timer events)

### 6502 Runtime
This is the second generation Hopper runtime for 6502.  Currently it (`r6502`) can be loaded into the emulator (`e6502`) under
the desktop environment and you can upload and debug Hopper programs on it using HopperMon (`hm`) or the Hopper debugger (`debug`) via the synthesized `COM0` connection. 

### Editor
The editor, `edit`, is a colour syntax highlighting editor for both Hopper (`.hs`) and 6502 assembly (`.asm`) projects that runs under
the Hopper desktop runtime. It also serves as the IDE with good project navigation tools and integration with both the Hopper and 6502 project building
toolchains. It can also upload successfully built projects (either Hopper or 6502 assembly) to your device and launch them directly in the debugger (`debug`).

### Debugger
Full source-level symbolic debugging experience (`debug`) which can be launched from the IDE (`edit`). Works with Hopper projects and 6502 assembly projects.
Works by connecting to the Hopper Runtime via a serial connection. This also works in emulation mode by connecting to the Portable Runtime (`runtime`) via a
synthesized `COM0` serial interface to a 2nd instance of the Hopper runtime running on the desktop.

### HopperMon
`hm` runs under the desktop runtime. It uses the same serial connection debugging protocol as the debugger (`debug`) but has more of a console-style interface.
It also has more utility commands than the source debugger and can step one Hopper VM instruction at a time (rather than one Hopper source line at a time in the GUI debugger).

### 6502 Emulator
`e6502` runs under the Hopper desktop runtime (on Windows only) and can be connected to by HopperMon (`hm`) or the source debugger (`debug`) via the IDE using
a synthesized `COM0` serial interface. This allows you to debug Hopper programs on the 6502 platform without a physical 6502 device.
The emulator itself also has a HopperMon-style interface that can be used to debug and single step through the 6502 code.

## What's Next?

1. more cross-platform development environment support (Linux ARM, macOS ARM, macOS x64)
2. deep sleep mode for the RP2350
3. a decent Z80 version
