Let me search for some specific classic educational programming problems:Perfect! Based on my exploration of Rosetta Code, I can see the classic educational programming problems. Let me search for one more specific example:Perfect! Now I have a great overview of Rosetta Code's educational programming problems. Based on my exploration, here's my analysis:

## **My Choice: FizzBuzz**

### **a) Good fit for HopperBASIC (limited capabilities):**

Looking at the classic BASIC implementation from the search results:

```basic
FOR number = 1 to 100
    if number mod 15 = 0 then 
        print "FizzBuzz"
    else if number mod 3 = 0 then 
        print "Fizz"
    else if number mod 5 = 0 then 
        print "Buzz"
    else 
        print number
    end if  
    end if
end if
next number
```

**Perfect HopperBASIC fit because:**
- âœ… **Simple control structures**: `for/next`, `if/then/else/endif`
- âœ… **Basic arithmetic**: `mod` operator (which you have working)  
- âœ… **Print statements**: Multiple print calls (which you have)
- âœ… **No complex data structures**: Just integers and strings
- âœ… **No arrays or advanced features**: Stays within your current capabilities

### **b) Most interesting to me as a goal:**

**Why FizzBuzz fascinates me for HopperBASIC:**

1. **The Ultimate Litmus Test**: FizzBuzz is described as "a simple programming task, which most decent programmers are expected to be able to easily write, but, reportedly, most interviewed software development candidates cannot write it. It's a kind of litmus test for programmers."

2. **Language Design Philosophy Validation**: If HopperBASIC can elegantly implement FizzBuzz, it proves your language design choices are sound. It's the "Hello World" of logic programming.

3. **Perfect Complexity Sweet Spot**: FizzBuzz hits the perfect balance - trivial enough that any working language should handle it, but complex enough to exercise:
   - Loops (`for/next`)
   - Conditionals (`if/then/else`)  
   - Arithmetic (`mod`)
   - Multiple code paths
   - Output formatting

4. **Historical Significance**: Having HopperBASIC solve this classic problem would be like getting your language's "merit badge" - it joins the ranks of serious programming languages.

**HopperBASIC Implementation:**
```hopper
func fizzbuzz()
    int number
    for number = 1 to 100
        if number mod 15 = 0 then
            print "FizzBuzz"
        else
            if number mod 3 = 0 then
                print "Fizz"
            else
                if number mod 5 = 0 then
                    print "Buzz"
                else
                    print number
                endif
            endif
        endif
    next number
endfunc

begin
    fizzbuzz()
end
```

**The Goal**: Get this working perfectly, then submit HopperBASIC to Rosetta Code! ðŸŽ¯
