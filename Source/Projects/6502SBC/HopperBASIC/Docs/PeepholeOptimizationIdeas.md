# Comprehensive Peephole Optimization Report

Based on thorough analysis of the assembly listings, here are the peephole optimization opportunities identified, organized by category and impact:

## üî¥ **HIGH IMPACT - Flag Operation Optimizations**

### 1. **Redundant SEC/CLC Operations**
Multiple patterns detected:
- **After conditional branches**: 
  ```asm
  0x5D12  0xF0 0x03       BEQ 0x5D17 (+3)
  0x5D14  0x38            SEC          ; REDUNDANT
  0x5D15  0x80 0x01       BRA 0x5D18
  0x5D17  0x18            CLC
  ```
- **After JSR to Error.CheckError()**: The function returns with C flag set/clear, but code often redundantly sets it again
- **Before RTS**: Multiple instances of `CLC` immediately before `RTS` when flag state is already known

### 2. **CMP #0 After Flag-Setting Instructions**
```asm
0x5D65  0xA5 0x26       LDA 0x26
0x5D67  0xC9 0x00       CMP # 0      ; REDUNDANT - LDA already sets Z flag
```
Instructions like `LDA`, `LDX`, `LDY`, `INC`, `DEC`, `INX`, `DEX`, `INY`, `DEY` already set Z and N flags appropriately.

### 3. **BIT Instruction Side Effects**
Pattern `BIT 0x21` appears frequently, often used only for flag side effects:
```asm
0x45FE  0x24 0x21       BIT 0x21
0x4600  0x60            RTS
```
If the flags aren't used, this instruction could be eliminated.

## üü° **MEDIUM IMPACT - Control Flow Optimizations**

### 4. **Branch to Next Instruction**
```asm
0x70C4  0xB0 0x01       BCS 0x70C7 (+1)
0x70C6  0x60            RTS
0x70C7  ...             ; next instruction
```
Can be inverted to `BCC` over larger code blocks, eliminating unnecessary branches.

### 5. **JMP to RTS Pattern**
```asm
0x4612  0x4C 0xE7 0x44  JMP 0x44E7  ; where 0x44E7 is just RTS
```
Replace with direct `RTS` to save cycles and bytes.

### 6. **Branch-to-Branch Chains**
Pattern of:
```asm
BEQ +3
SEC
BRA +1
CLC
```
Could be restructured to eliminate the unconditional branch.

## üü¢ **LOW IMPACT - Register/Memory Optimizations**

### 7. **Unnecessary Push/Pull Operations**
```asm
0x55DD  0x48            PHA
0x55DE  0xDA            PHX
0x55DF  0x5A            PHY
// ... operations that don't modify A, X, Y ...
0x561D  0x7A            PLY
0x561E  0xFA            PLX
0x561F  0x68            PLA
```
If registers aren't modified, the push/pull can be eliminated.

### 8. **Consecutive JSR to Same Function**
```asm
0x706F  0x20 0x0F 0x46  JSR 0x460F  ; Error.CheckError()
0x707D  0x20 0x0F 0x46  JSR 0x460F  ; Same call again
```
Consider caching error state if unchanged between calls.

### 9. **Double Testing of Conditions**
```asm
0x55F3  0xA5 0x14       LDA 0x14
0x55F5  0x05 0x15       ORA 0x15
0x55F7  0xF0 0x1B       BEQ 0x5614  ; Tests combined result
// ... later individual tests of same values
```
If combined result is known, individual tests may be redundant.

### 10. **Store-Load Patterns**
Watch for patterns where:
- `STA location` followed by `LDA location` with no intervening writes
- Setting a value then immediately testing it

## üìä **Implementation Priority**

### Highest Priority (Most Impact, Easiest to Implement):
1. **CMP #0 elimination** after flag-setting instructions
2. **JMP to RTS** replacement
3. **Branch to next instruction** optimization
4. **Redundant CLC/SEC** after known flag states

### Medium Priority:
5. **Error.CheckError() flag optimization** - requires understanding of error handling flow
6. **Push/Pull elimination** - needs register liveness analysis
7. **BIT instruction elimination** - needs flag usage analysis

### Lower Priority (Complex Analysis Required):
8. **Consecutive JSR optimization** - needs state tracking
9. **Store-Load optimization** - needs memory access tracking
10. **Branch chain restructuring** - may require code restructuring

## üí° **Estimated Impact**
- **Code size reduction**: 5-10% based on frequency of patterns
- **Cycle count reduction**: 10-15% in error handling paths
- **Most frequent pattern**: Redundant flag operations after Error.CheckError() calls

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Recommendations**

1. **Start with single-instruction optimizations**: CMP #0 elimination, JMP to RTS
2. **Add pattern matching for flag operations**: Track flag state through linear code
3. **Implement branch optimizations**: Requires local control flow analysis
4. **Advanced optimizations**: Register liveness and memory tracking for push/pull and load/store optimizations

These optimizations maintain semantic equivalence while reducing both code size and execution time, particularly benefiting frequently-executed error handling paths.
